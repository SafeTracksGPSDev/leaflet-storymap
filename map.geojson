        "description": "Bosco Homes has been using the SafeTracks Personal GPS tracking device since April 2012. Having these devices in our programs has increased the safety and security of our staff and clients and has given our staff a peace of mind when working alone. Over the past year, weï¿½ve had to use the system twice. The response time by SafeTracks Operators was impeccable. Any service needs were answered and corrected by the SafeTracks personnel immediately."

We tested the devices for victims until we were satisfied that we understood the technology and the application of the technology for the victims program.\nWe are convinced the GPS personal device and the 24 hr. monitoring is an enhancement to the safety planning with victims. SafeTracks is working with CAWES to provide GPS solutions in domestic violence safety planning and offender accountability. We are very excited to be a part of this emerging technology."

        "description": "We first heard of this company due to the work they are doing with the Central Alberta Women's Emergency Shelter and the Red Deer RCMP. We tested the devices with SafeTracks. Two of our team members faithfully carried the devices for two months and the feedback was very positive. The added safety of having this device gave them the reassurance that, no matter where they were, if they were in distress, help was just a push of a button away."
